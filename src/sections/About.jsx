            Hi, I'm Niraj Sonule, a passionate Frontend Developer from Badlapur.
            I hold a BSc in Computer Science and a Master of Computer
            Applications (MCA). Although I’m at the beginning of my professional
            journey, my academic background and internship experience have given
            me a solid understanding of web development fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg w-2xl mt-1.5">
            I’m eager to learn and collaborate, and I’m looking forward to the
            opportunity to bring my enthusiasm and technical skills to new
            projects.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg w-2xl mt-1.5">
            Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out for
            collaborations or opportunities!
          </p>
